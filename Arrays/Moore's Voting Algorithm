In this algorithm we have to first make two variable
    int ele         --that will initially nothing store
    int count       --count the frequency of that first element

    the first element of array will be store in ele and count will become 1
    then the next elements can be
                equal to this element               -count ++
                not equal to this element           -count --

    while iterating in the array if the count will become 0 at the ith index then then new ele will be i+1;
    and count will 1 and working same


    after the iteration we have an element now in 2nd loop we have to check the counting of that element in that array
    we initialize a variable count1 that will be 0 and if arr[i]==ele the count will be ++


    in the end check if count1>n/2
                                return ele;

                    else
                                return -1;
